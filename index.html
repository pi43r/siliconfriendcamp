          The theme of the retreat is "Conversations with Computers". Our goal
          is to enable embodied networks through the development of new forms of
          computational intelligence. <br />
          We invite people of all ages and backgrounds who are interested in
          machine intelligence, cyborgs, data feminism, conversation design,
          telepathy, art, science, and future societies. There are no specific
          requirements, except for a certain level of curiosity and
          adventurousness. You should be open to try new things, and be willing
          to share your ideas and experiences. <br />
          Before we meet in a cottage in the Austrian Alps, we will hold virtual
          gatherings, where we will get to know each other with our silicon
          companions. Together, we will look into the future of digital people,
          explore the possibilities and challenges and discuss the kind of
          relationships we want to have with our AI-cousins. We believe that
          everyone is an expert and encourage participants to share their
          knowledge and exchange ideas. We want to create a setting where humans
          and machines can freely exchange information and value. But we also
          want to encourage a critical gaze on current AI models and develop
          alternative ideas, far from capitalist norms. <br />

          Your submission should identify an area of interest with a tangible
          goal that can be developed in a couple of months. While we are looking
          for people interested in artificial intelligence, we define the term
          very broadly and would like to push the boundaries of what alternative
          intelligences mean. <br />
          Your project can be an autonomous robot friend, but it can also come
          in the form of written texts, videos, performances, games or something
          completely different. <br />
          Please also think about a way of how to share your ideas connected to
          your project with others through small exercises, workshops, focused
          discussions, movie-screenings etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your submission will be reviewed by servus team members and invited
          guests to form a diverse selection of around 10 humans. If you are
          interested fill out the form, it shouldn't take you longer than 1
          hour.
